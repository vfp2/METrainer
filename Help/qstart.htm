<P><FONT size=4>METrainer is a new and exciting game designed to 
increase your mental abilities. On the sign in screen, first choose a sign-in name, such as your name 
or initials. Also select Bounded Walk Processing and press Start. You will see a golden ball in the middle of the 
screen. Then, using your focused intention, try to make the ball spin as if rolling "away" by 
concentrating at the top of the ball to "push" it. While you are concentrating, 
press the space bar (or other key) or click the left mouse button.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>If you are successful, the ball will begin to roll away and a light
will appear at the top of the ball. If not, the ball will roll toward you and a small
light will appear at the bottom of the ball. You will also hear a tone that is higher in
pitch when the top light appears. Continue by pressing the key (or clicking the mouse) 
about once a second, while concentrating on making the ball roll away. The 
rolling of the ball will speed up as you get a string of the same 
results.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>You can change the direction that you want the ball to 
roll by clicking "Options" and then "Change Direction". If you do that, the 
larger light will appear at the bottom of the ball when you successfully nudge 
it "toward" you. You may have to get a number of successes to turn the ball 
around if it is rolling against your desired direction.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>You can also select the type of mental ability you 
want to practice. Do this by clicking on "ME Mode", and then choose one of the 
three abilities. Clicking Affect is to practice directly affecting objects with 
your mental intention. Select Reveal to practice sensing hidden events. Try 
Predict for predicting future events.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>These Mental abilities are skills that you can learn. 
The ME Rating level at the right of the screen measures your ability and 
progress. Levels above 4 or 5 indicate some ability, and above 7 shows strong 
progress. Each higher number is about twice as hard to reach. Increasing these mental 
abilities can take practice and time. Don't be discouraged if your results seem 
low at first. You will improve with practice.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
