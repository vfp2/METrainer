<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><FONT size=5>What is METrainer 
PC?</FONT></STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>METrainer PC is intended to exercise, measure 
and increase your mental abilities.&nbsp; The program uses quantum mechanical 
properties to calculate output or "ME Bits" that are compared to "Target" 
information. Your mental intention causes an entanglement or 
correlation between the ME Bits and the Target information.&nbsp; This 
increases the probability of achieving the intended result. Intended results can 
be either a match between ME Bits and Target information (Target High setting), 
or no-match (Target Low setting). A "Hit" is registered when the intended result 
is achieved; otherwise, a "Miss" is registered.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG><FONT size=5>ME Modes</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Three different ME Modes or types may be selected for 
exercising with METrainer. These are 1) Affect – directly influencing 
material objects by mind, 2) Reveal – obtaining knowledge of 
information or events hidden from the usual five senses, 3) Predict – 
obtaining knowledge of future events that cannot be inferred from presently 
known information. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Selection of one of these modes only changes the way Target 
information is produced. For Affect, the Target information is set to a 
binary value of all 1's. Your mental effort influences the METrainer to produce 
ME Bits to match this target for a "Target High", or not match for a "Target 
Low" target setting. In Reveal mode, the Target information is selected at 
random by a true random number generator before the beginning of a trial. Your 
mental effort causes the ME Bits to correlate with the hidden Target information. 
Predict mode produces the Target information by a true random number 
generator after the trial is completed. Your mental effort causes the ME Bits to 
correlate with, or predict, the future Target Bits.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>In each ME Mode the desired outcome is for the ME Bits to 
match the Target information for the "Target High" setting, and to not match for 
the "Target Low" setting. "Target High" means trying to produce a higher number 
of matches than expected by chance alone, and "Target Low" means trying to 
produce a lower number of matches than expected by chance alone. The number of 
successes expected by chance is just 50% of the number of trials.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Changing the ME Mode during a session will reset both the 
statistics and the ME Rating level.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></FONT>
<FONT size=4><STRONG><FONT size=5>Menu Bar<BR></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;<BR>
The menu bar at the top of the METrainer window provides access to options and settings. Click “File”, then “Auto Test” to start the Auto Test function, which verifies unbiased functioning of the METrainer with no player interaction. Click “ME Mode”, and then either “Affect”, “Reveal” or “Predict” to change the mental skill to be practiced. The “Options” menu includes a checkbox, “Show Stats”, to check for displaying the statistics on the METrainer window. The “Reset Stats” button is on the bottom of the statistics window when displayed. The Options menu also includes “Mute Sounds”, which mutes the auditory feedback when checked, and “Change Target” that toggles between the “Target High” and “Target Low” when clicked. The “Help” menu contains the “Quick Start” and full “Help” file.</FONT><FONT size=4><BR>&nbsp;<BR>
The selected ME Mode and Target Direction, High or Low, are shown on the right side of the Menu bar.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></FONT>
<FONT size=4><STRONG><FONT size=5>How to Use<BR></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;<BR>To use 
METrainer PC, first select the ME Mode to be practiced by clicking on "ME 
Mode", and then clicking on the desired mode. Then select the Target High or 
Target Low. The High/Low selection determines whether you want to intend an 
increase in ME Bit/Target matches (Target High) or a decrease in ME Bit/Target 
matches (Target Low). Sit comfortably in front of the computer and focus your 
intention on causing the desired outcome.&nbsp; While holding this intention, 
press a key or click the left mouse button to produce a trial.&nbsp; Your mental effort 
directly interacts with the properties of the patented true random 
number generator and unique processing to increase the number of correct 
results.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Motion of a golden ball on the METrainer window and the Hit or 
Miss lights above and below the ball will show an immediate response to each 
trial. A successful trial lights the larger of the two indicators and nudges the 
ball to roll as if you had pushed it on the edge where the indicator is 
positioned. For example, when "Target High" is selected, a "Hit" will cause the 
larger indicator to appear above the ball and nudge it to "roll" away. A "Miss" 
lights the small, bottom indicator and nudges the ball in the opposite 
direction. When "Target Low" is selected, the larger indicator will appear below 
the ball each time a successful outcome is achieved. For a "Target Low" setting, 
the desire is to lower the number of matches between the ME Bits and Target 
Bits.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>A successful trial will always light the larger indicator. The 
ball rolls faster as if pushed by the larger indicator as more successful trials 
are registered. A string of unsuccessful trials will cause the ball to roll in 
the opposite direction. A sound is also produced for each trial. The higher tone 
corresponds to the upper indicator and the lower tone corresponds to the lower 
indicator. This is true regardless of the Target High/Low setting. Pressing 
"Reset Stats" will reset all statistics to their default values, but will not 
affect the ME Level slider.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Try different visualizations or techniques to find what works 
best for you. This is an important part of learning with the METrainer. For 
example, form a clear image of the desired outcome, such as the larger light 
turning on or the ball rolling in the desired direction. Then press a key or 
mouse button while forcefully projecting a "pulse" of mental effort. The 
visualization may be of hearing the sound corresponding to the larger light, or 
moving the ME Level slider higher, or just feeling a successful result. Another 
approach uses meditation to get to an altered state where the visualization 
becomes more effective.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>There is no indication that physical energy is required to 
achieve the intended results. However, some physical effort seems to accompany 
the process, especially when trying the mental effort pulse method. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT size=5><STRONG>ME Rating 
Levels</STRONG><BR></FONT>&nbsp;<BR>The scale on the right of the METrainer 
window indicates your present ability rating.&nbsp; The number in the 
oval-shaped slider is the approximate rating.&nbsp; Ratings, or ME Levels, 
range from 1.0 to 20. A rating of 10 or more is very high, while 20 is only 
achievable by a master of this mental skill.&nbsp; Each higher rating number 
requires about twice the ability to achieve.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the ME 
Rating is a statistical measurement. That means that the peak levels displayed 
in the slider can be the result of chance. The average ME Level produced by 
chance is 3.8 for any 100-trial session and 4.7 for a 200-trial session. The 
rating can be used to both monitor your progress and to compare your ability 
with others.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Resetting the statistics will not affect the ME Rating slider, 
but changing the ME Mode during a session will reset both the statistics and 
the ME Rating level.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></FONT><FONT size=4><STRONG><FONT 
size=5>Training Guidance</FONT><BR></STRONG>&nbsp;<BR>Developing any untapped 
skill requires desire and training.&nbsp; Most new players will get ratings of 
3+ to 5, partly by chance.&nbsp; After a period of practice, levels of 5+ to 7 
can be reached.&nbsp; Ratings of 7+ to 11 usually require significant 
development, and ratings of 11+ to 15 are extraordinary.&nbsp; Exceeding 15 
indicates inherent and significant mental abilities.&nbsp; Only a very few will reach 
the "master" range of 15 to 20.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Nearly every player has a few 
common experiences.&nbsp; This information can assist in more effective 
growth.<BR>1) There is always an initial period of learning.&nbsp; Don't expect 
immediate results.<BR>2) The learning is long-term and cumulative: you will see 
constant and enduring advancement as you train from day-to-day and 
week-to-week.<BR>3) The mental abilities learned by using METrainer will start 
to pop up spontaneously in your daily life.<BR>4) When using METrainer, slow 
down and refocus if you "Miss" or have a series of "Misses".&nbsp; Start at 
about one trial per second.&nbsp; Even the highest rated player will lose effectiveness above a certain speed of testing.<BR>5) METrainer is not a 
"mind-reading" machine.&nbsp; A whim or casual thought will accomplish 
very little.&nbsp; You may find certain modes of meditative states will work better 
for you.&nbsp; Relax, but be clearly present with your visualized or intended 
outcome.<BR>6) The size of the mental effect on METrainer will tend to decline 
during a training session due to fatigue and decrease in focus.<BR>7) If you 
feel unwell, distracted, upset or too tired, your results will be either very 
low or neutral.&nbsp; Strong negative emotions occasionally cause the accuracy 
to drop below random expectations.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT 
size=5><STRONG>Statistics</STRONG><BR></FONT>&nbsp;<BR>A set of rigorous 
statistics is provided for the more technically minded researcher.&nbsp; The 
statistics include:<BR>1) Total - the number of trials since the beginning of 
the training session or since the "Reset Stats" button was pressed.<BR>2) Hit 
Rate - the fractional number of correct desired outcomes or "Hits" relative to 
the "Total" counter.<BR>3) p(HR) - the cumulative binomial distribution 
probability that the current "Hit Rate" or higher could have been produced by 
chance.<BR>4) Win HR - the fractional number of Hits in a moving window of 
length 41 trials.<BR>5) p(Win HR) - the cumulative binomial distribution 
probability that the current "Win HR" or higher could have been produced by 
chance.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The numerical ME Rating is the greater of<BR>1) -Log[p(Win 
HR)] and<BR>2) -Log[p(HR)], when the number of trials is greater than or equal 
to 41. Log indicates the logarithm base 2. The ratings are rounded to the 
nearest 0.1.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG><FONT size=5>Auto Test</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT size=4>The Auto Test function confirms unbiased results of the 
PMETrainer during "non-influenced" operation. Any ME Mode and either Target 
direction can be selected for Auto Testing. METrainer must be unobserved while 
running Auto Test to prevent mental influence.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>To run, click "File" and then "Auto Test". Long term testing 
will produce a p(HR) typically between .01 and .99. Since this is a statistical 
measure, the p(HR) will exceed these limits 2% of the 
time.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR></FONT><FONT size=4><STRONG><FONT size=5>Data 
Logging</FONT><BR></STRONG>&nbsp;<BR>METrainer automatically creates a folder 
named "METrainer Data" in your "My Documents" folder for logging data produced 
by operating the METrainer. "METrainer Data" contains a subfolder for each 
different user name and also for the Auto Test function. The subfolders are 
named "[username]" or "autotest". These subfolders in turn contain two folders 
named "Archive" and "Session", as well as a file named "[username]_data.csv". 
The "[username]_data.csv" file contains the cumulative logged data for 
"username". This is a comma-separated variable (CSV) formatted file and can be 
opened directly in Microsoft(r) Excel. The first row of the data file is a 
header with fields indicating: UTC (Universal Time Coordinated in seconds since 
0000 Hours, January 1, 1900) at the beginning of the first logged training 
session, username and program name with version number. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>The data 
from the training or Auto Test session begins in the next row. Each row includes 
the information from a single trial. The fields in the data rows are: 
UTC-timestamp at the end of each trial, Hit (1) or Miss (0), Target High (1) or 
Low (0) and ME Mode; Affect (1), Reveal (2) or Predict (3). 
The session file is closed when the METrainer program is closed. Resetting the 
statistics does not affect the data logging.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>The "Session" folder contains the same data and format as the 
cumulative data file. Each session file, named "[username]_[UTC-timestamp].csv", 
includes a header indicating the UTC at the beginning of the session.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>If the cumulative data file becomes too large (Excel can only 
open files with 65,536 lines.), the entire file is moved to the "Archive" folder 
and a new cumulative file is started. Each archived file is named 
"[username]_data_[UTC-timestamp].csv", and the UTC is the same as the first 
trial in the file.</FONT></P>
